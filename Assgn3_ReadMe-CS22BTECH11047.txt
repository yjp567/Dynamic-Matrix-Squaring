Compiling and Executing the Code:

1. Open the terminal in the directory where the source code and input file is located.
2. To compile, run the command: g++ Assgn3_Src-CS22BTECH11047.cpp
3. To execute, run the command: ./a.out

The required output file, "out.txt" will be created in the same directory (or will overwrite, if already present).

Generating the file "inp.txt" :

1. I have made a C++ program "helper.cpp" to generate the input file.
2. You can change the value of 'n', 'k', 'rowInc' in the code.
3. Now, compile by the command: g++ helper.cpp
4. Run the command: ./a.out 
5. This will generate the input file with required value of 'n', 'k' and 'rowInc'.
6. Note that the entries of the matrix are randomly choosen between 0 to 9 (both inclusive).
